# tsmethods

Foundation packages with general methods/classes used by other
**tsmodels** packages as well as plotting for prediction and
distribution classes conforming to the current probabilistic framework.
Also includes functions for ensembling using a copula methodology.

## Installation

For installation instructions and vignettes for **tsmodels** packages,
see <https://tsmodels.github.io/>.

## To Do

\[x\] Create tsequation for each of the packages to generate latex
output of both the generic model equation used as well as option for
populating with actual parameter values.

\[x\] Switch to using either ggplot2 or plotly for plotting output of
tsmodel.predict and tsmodel.distribution.

\[x\] Check consistency of colors and output for plots across packages
(for estimated object).

\[x\] Check consistency of summary output across packages (for estimated
object).

\[x\] Create tsanimate method for animating walkthrough in tsbacktest
output.

\[x\] Convert documentation to roxygen \[ongoing\]

\[x\] Enhance tsconvert method to generate SEM model from MEM and add
appendix in vignette for proof based on Casals et al.Â paper (James
Nesbit).
